## CIT281 Projects
- [Project 1](https://lizz02.github.io/cit281-p1): Practice completing tasks using the command line interface and writing non-server node.js javascript code.
- [Project 2](https://lizz02.github.io/cit281-p2): Continue using the CLI and use github to refactor node.js javascript from the previous project. 
- [Project 3](https://lizz02.github.io/cit281-p3): Write node.js javascript which can find the value of coin objects and update node.js server code so that a coinCount function can be imported and used by different routes employing the "GET" verb. Practice initializing and using fastify.
- [Project 4](https://lizz02.github.io/cit281-p4): Create a node.js server which can handle requests using the "GET" "PUSH" "POST" and "DELETE" verbs. A REST API will work with data in the form of questions and answers which will be stored, retrieved, and updated according to server requests.
- [Project 5](https://lizz02.github.io/cit281-p5): Update and write node.js javascript code to execute a "monster game" which will report random drains to each monster's health within the console.
- [Project 6](https://lizz02.github.io/cit281-p6): Using two classes which inherit from the class "shape", write node.js javascript which can calculate the perimeter and area of a shape based on an array of its sides' length.
